# Final Project
Here is my final project which is a website for my mom's hair salon: Gretchen's Hair Salon https://aej37.github.io/CDMfinalProject2022/


The website includes a home page, products page, services page, and a consultation page. It would be used by her existing and potential clients. This site would reduce the overflow of phone calls that they get at the salon because people would be able to see the services and products that they offer online. Also instead of calling the salon to ask to schedule an appointment, they would schedule a consultation online and the stylists would call them. This would be an extremely useful asset to my mom's business.
